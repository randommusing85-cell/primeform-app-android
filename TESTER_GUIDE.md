## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why do I need to allow "Unknown sources"?**
A: This app isn't on the Google Play Store yet. It's a test version. Once it launches publicly, you'll install it normally.

**Q: Is my data safe?**
A: Yes! All data is stored locally on your phone using Isar (offline-first database). Nothing is sent to external servers except when you use AI features (nutrition/workout plan generation).

**Q: Can I use this long-term?**
A: This is just a test! Features may change or break. Once we launch v1.0, you'll get the stable version.

**Q: The app crashes! What do I do?**
A: Please tell us what you were doing when it crashed. Try deleting and reinstalling the app. If it keeps happening, let us know!

**Q: Can I share this with friends?**
A: Please ask first! We're keeping this to a small group initially. Once it's more stable, we'll expand testing.

**Q: How long will testing last?**
A: About 2 weeks for this version. We'll gather feedback, fix issues, and potentially send v0.1.1 or v0.2.
