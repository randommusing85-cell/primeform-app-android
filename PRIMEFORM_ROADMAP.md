## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (v0.1 → v0.2)

### Priority 1: Internal Testing & Validation (Week 1-2)

**Goal:** Validate core loop with real users

#### Testing Checklist:
```
📋 User Acceptance Testing
□ Test complete onboarding flow
□ Generate nutrition plan → Track meals for 7 days
□ Generate workout plan → Complete 3 workouts
□ Test daily check-ins for consistency
□ Verify calendar shows workout history correctly
□ Test workout completion flow end-to-end
□ Test AI Coach after 7 days
□ Verify 14-day plan locks work
□ Test cycle tracking calculations
□ Test post-partum guidance
□ Verify notification system
□ Test offline functionality
□ Check analytics events fire correctly

🐛 Bug Hunting
□ Find any crashes or errors
□ Test edge cases (empty states, no internet, etc.)
□ Check UI on different screen sizes
□ Test with real menstrual cycle data
□ Verify post-partum calculations
□ Test injury selector edge cases

💬 Feedback Collection
□ Is the onboarding clear?
□ Are the plan locks frustrating or helpful?
□ Is the AI Coach useful?
□ Is the calendar intuitive?
□ Is meal logging too tedious?
□ What features are missing?
□ Where do users get stuck?
```

**Action Items:**
1. Deploy to 3-5 internal testers (friends/family)
2. Create feedback form (Google Forms or Typeform)
3. Schedule 1-week check-in calls
4. Track usage with Firebase Analytics
5. Document all bugs in GitHub Issues

---

### Priority 2: Critical Bug Fixes & Polish (Week 2-3)

**Based on Internal Testing Feedback:**

#### Expected Issues to Fix:
```
🔧 Likely Fixes Needed:
□ Add "Edit Meal" functionality (currently can only delete)
□ Add workout notes/feedback field
□ Improve error messages
□ Add loading states for AI generation
□ Better empty states (no plan, no meals, etc.)
□ Add "Skip Workout" functionality with reason
□ Improve calendar performance with large datasets
□ Add pull-to-refresh on key screens
□ Better offline sync indicators
□ Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

🎨 UI/UX Polish:

```

---

### Priority 3: Missing Provider (Critical)

**⚠️ URGENT:** `weeklyMacroTotalsProvider` is referenced but not implemented!

**File:** `lib/state/providers.dart`

**Add this provider:**
```dart
final weeklyMacroTotalsProvider = FutureProvider.autoDispose<List<DailyMacroTotal>>((ref) async {
  final repo = ref.watch(primeRepoProvider);
  return repo.getDailyMacroTotals(7); // Last 7 days
});
```

**This fixes:** `MacroAdherenceCard` on home screen

## 🎯 Phase 3: Identity & Motivation Layer

### The "Boring Middle" Problem

**Issue:** Weeks 4-12 are where most users drop off
- Initial excitement fades
- Progress slows down
- Habits not yet automatic
- No visible transformation yet

**Solution:** Identity-based features

```
🏆 Achievement System (Non-Gamified):
□ Consistency streaks
  - "14 days of check-ins"
  - "4 weeks on same plan" (anti-optimization badge)
  - "Completed a full cycle of training"

□ Milestones (not PRs)
  - "First month complete"
  - "Survived the boring middle"
  - "100 workouts logged"
  - "365 days of tracking"

□ Identity Reinforcement
  - "You're someone who shows up"
  - "You're building the habit"
  - Progress photos (optional, private)
  - Reflection prompts (weekly)

□ Community (Optional)
  - Anonymous progress sharing
  - "Others like you are doing X"
  - Accountability partners (opt-in)
  - Private support groups (menstrual/postpartum)
```

## 🔮 Long-Term Vision (6-12 months)

### 1. MCP Integration (Premium Differentiator)

**Model Context Protocol** for AI coaching

**What it enables:**
- AI coach that remembers EVERYTHING
- Contextual advice based on full history
- "You struggled with squats 3 weeks ago, how's it going?"
- Longitudinal pattern recognition
- Truly personalized coaching

**Implementation:**
- Requires backend infrastructure
- Store conversation history
- Context window management
- Privacy considerations (user data)

**This is your MOAT.** No other fitness app has this.

---

### 2. Singapore-Specific Features (Competitive Moat)

**Hawker Food Database:**
```
□ Macro data for 100+ local dishes
  - Chicken rice (white/brown/roast)
  - Char kway teow
  - Nasi lemak
  - Laksa
  - Roti prata
  - Ban mian
  - Economic rice (mixed dishes)
  - etc.

□ Location-based suggestions
  - "Hawker centers near you"
  - "High-protein options at X hawker"

□ Meal prep for Singaporean context
  - Meal prep services integration
  - Budget-friendly options
  - Catering recommendations
```

**Why it matters:**
- Every other fitness app is US-centric
- Singaporeans struggle to track local food
- This is YOUR competitive advantage
- Local apps are poorly designed
- You understand the market

---

### 3. Advanced Women's Health

```
□ PCOS management protocols
□ Perimenopause training adjustments  
□ Pregnancy-safe workout modifications
□ Breastfeeding nutrition support
□ Return-to-running post-partum program
□ Pelvic floor PT exercise library
□ Integration with wearables (Oura, Whoop) for cycle tracking
```

## 🚨 Critical Decisions Needed

### 1. **Free vs Paid Strategy**
- Launch 100% free initially?
- Or launch with paid tier from day 1?
- **Recommendation:** Start free, add paid after validation

### 2. **Target Audience**
- Focus on women only? (current design)
- Or open to all genders?
- **Recommendation:** Market to women, but don't restrict men

### 3. **Geographic Focus**
- Singapore-first (hawker food moat)?
- Or global from start?
- **Recommendation:** Global app, Singapore features as premium/unique

### 4. **AI Features**
- Keep simple AI (current)?
- Or invest in MCP for premium tier?
- **Recommendation:** Validate product first, then add MCP
