# PrimeForm / PhysIQ  
*A calm, intelligent fitness system for consistency over confusion*

---

## Overview

PrimeForm (working name: PhysIQ) is a fitness and nutrition app designed to reduce confusion, overwhelm, and decision fatigue—especially for beginners, restarters, and busy adults.

Rather than chasing perfect accuracy or extreme optimisation, PrimeForm prioritises:
- consistency
- clarity
- conservative, safe guidance
- long-term habit building

The app combines structured fitness principles with AI-assisted coaching, while deliberately avoiding cluttered dashboards, social feeds, and obsession-driven mechanics.

## Product Philosophy

**What PrimeForm believes**
- Consistency matters more than precision
- Habits come before optimisation
- Calm guidance beats aggressive motivation
- Trends matter more than day-to-day noise
- AI should interpret and guide—not judge or shame

**What PrimeForm is not**
- Not a calorie database race
- Not a social fitness platform
- Not a "30-day shredded" app
- Not an analytics overload tool

---

## Target Users

- Beginners who feel lost
- People restarting fitness in their 30s–40s
- Users overwhelmed by conflicting advice
- Users who "know what to do" but struggle with consistency
- Working adults who want guidance without obsession

---

## Monetisation & Control

- RevenueCat is used for subscriptions and entitlements
- Paywall modes are remotely configurable:
  - **OFF** – full access (beta/testing)
  - **SOFT** – limited premium usage
  - **HARD** – premium locked behind subscription
- Entitlements are checked:
  - client-side (UI/UX gating)
  - server-side (AI cost protection)
- Paywall can be toggled without rebuilding the app

## Long-Term Vision

PrimeForm / PhysIQ aims to become:
> A trusted, calm fitness companion people rely on—like MyFitnessPal for logging, but personalised, humane, and intelligent.

The app is designed to grow with the user:
- simple when they need structure
- powerful when they're ready for control
- always grounded in safety and realism

**Core Differentiator:**  
Unlike apps that guess your schedule or create false guilt, PrimeForm knows *exactly* when you planned to train and measures consistency against *your* plan—not an arbitrary standard.
